   Proofs/FromBytesSpec.lean — phase 2, decompress step 2: the byte parser.

   `FieldElement51::from_bytes` loads five 64-bit little-endian windows at
   byte offsets 0/6/12/19/24, shifts by 0/3/6/1/12, and masks to 51 bits —
   the windows tile bits 0..254 exactly, so

       feVal (from_bytes b) = bytesVal b mod 2²⁵⁵            (from_bytes_spec)

   — the top bit is discarded, everything else is exact. This is the y-parse
   of decompression: for a canonical encoding (y-residue + sign bit), the
   parsed field element denotes exactly the y-residue.

   Structure: a generic 8-byte loader lemma (`load8_at_spec`, the disjoint-OR
   idiom), a pure window/digit identity (`limbs_of_bytes`), and the walk.
